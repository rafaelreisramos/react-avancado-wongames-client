This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate based in a course called [React Avan√ßado](https://reactavancado.com.br/).

It is a more generic one (without [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)) and can be used as a starting point for any [React](https://reactjs.org/) project based on Next.js.

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Commands

- `build`: creates the production build version
- `start`: starts a simple server with the build production code
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
- `test:watch`: runs jest in watch mode
